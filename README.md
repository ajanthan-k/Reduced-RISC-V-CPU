# Reduced-RISC-V-CPU
Lab 4 groupwork

Group members:
Clifford Chan   
Ajanthan Kanagasabapathy   
Erenkai Zhu   
Jim Zhu

Tasks for each member:
1. Program Counter and related adders.
2. The Register File, ALU and the related MUX.
3. The Control Unit, the Sign-extension Unit and the instruction memory.
4. The testbench and verification of the design working via gtkWave and Vbuddy (where appropriate).

We will discuss who does what soon.

On the repo for your team, we should have:
- A README.md that show evidences of the CPU working properly with the program.
- A short narrative to state the challenges you encountered as a team.
- Comments about any design decisions you made that are not obvious.
- A reflection on what you might do differently if you were to start again.
